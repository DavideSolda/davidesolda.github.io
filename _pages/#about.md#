I am a PhD candidate at the Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/), under the supervision of professor [Thomas Eiter](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/staff/eiter/). Here, I am part of the LogiCS-COFUND doctoral programme.

Broadly, my research interests lie in automated reasoning, and particularly in stream reasoning and planning.

I received
- a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en) (2019, final score 110L/110)
- a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en) (2022, final score 110L/110.)
- a Master's Diploma at the School for [Advanced Studies of the University of Udine](https://scuolasuperiore.uniud.it/?set_language=en) 

Both the bachelor's and master's thesis were supervised by professor [Agostino Dovier](http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~agostino.dovier/).

Work experiences:
- [OsmerFVG](https://www.osmer.fvg.it/home.php?ln=-en), where I worked on metereological datasets for 7 months under the supervision of [Agostino Manzato](https://digilander.libero.it/agostino.manzato/).
- [Fondazione Brune Kesler (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/), where I worked on an [ESA project](https://es.fbk.eu/index.php/projects/robdt/) for 6 months under the supervision of [Stefano Tonetta](https://es.fbk.eu/?author_name=stefano-tonetta).
