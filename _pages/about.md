I am a PhD candidate at the Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) at TU Wien, under the supervision of Thomas Eiter. Here, I am part of the LogiCS-COFUND doctoral programme.

Broadly, my research interests lie in automated reasoning, and particularly in stream reasoning and planning.

I obtained
- a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Udine
- a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Udine
- a Master's Diploma at the School for Advanced Studies of the University of Udine 

Work experiences:
- OsmerFVG, where I worked on metereological datasets
- Fondazione Brune Kesler (FBK), where I worked on runtime verification
