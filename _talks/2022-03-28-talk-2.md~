The ROBDT project aims at developing a Robotic Digital Twin framework that combines data-driven models, physics-based and  symbolic models and uses online data and data analytics to adapt models at runtime. The digital twin will support the robotic asset  operations by providing timing and reliable prediction and by supporting what-if analysis to assess multiple scenarios.
