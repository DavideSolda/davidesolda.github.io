The stable model semantics of logic programs has been characterized by
Equilibrium Logic, which is a non-monotonic formalism that selects
models from the (monotonic) intermediate logic of Here-and-There. It
provides stable models for arbitrary propositional formulas and has
been fruitfully extended to different modal languages. Among them are
theories in the syntax of Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL), giving
rise to Temporal Equilibrium logic (TEL) based on Temporal
Here-and-There (THT). In TEL, models are selected that minimize truth
among THT traces of the same length.  In this paper, we consider a
selection that in addition may reduce the number of transitions in a trace, 
  intuitively forming a contraction of it. We thus introduce contracted THT and contracted TEL  on top of a model
selection on a logical basis. The resulting c-stable models can be
viewed as stable models in TEL that can not be summarized into a
smaller trace. We illustrate contraction on several examples related
to logic programming and explore several properties, like the relation
to TEL and LTL, and in particular the connection to the LTL
property of stuttering.
